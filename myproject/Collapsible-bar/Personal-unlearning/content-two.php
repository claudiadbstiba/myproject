    <h1>What is love?</h1>
    How do you feel when you feel loved?
    <br>
    What is it that someone needs to do so that you feel loved?
    <br>
    How do you know exactly that it is actually love?
    <br>
    Can you feel it all the time, or in very rare ocasion throughout the day?
    <br>
    How would it be if love will not depend on others but just on you?
    <br>
    I came to the undrstanding that no one can make somebody happy.
    Happines have to preexist before you can fully receive any other form of love coming from outside of you.
    <br>
    The moment you are centred and you know who you really are, any other form of love coming from the others is a bonus.
    I use to go for walks and I loot at my inner state. I am starting to smile, and I feel incredible happy.
    My circumstances have not changed substantially, i am living the same level of life as i did one year ago.
    But the way I live every aspect of every moment is substantially transformed.
