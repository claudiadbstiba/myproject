    <h1>And the thruth shall set you free!</h1>
    I have achieved so much. And then i got to the conclusion that none of it is real. I could see the repetitive paterns and I realized that there can be a different way of living this experience called life. 
    It feels like a fullmouth of fresh air.
    Actually, all of this cannot be true.
    Have you evere thought of that?
    I came to the conclusion that humans language can't represent accurately the feelings.
    It is just to narrow to express the complete truth.
    Going back to where I started, my story is not MY story. And 
    I believe this applies to majority of us. <br>
    I was the result of the education, the result of the society. 
    Each and every experience that I had in my early years 
    was deeply rooted into my last piece of cell of my body.
    I could not know a different way of living the life, other than what i have learned.
    I was educated mostly by peopple who didn't know a crap about 
    what they were doing. I can only feel so much love and gratitude for all their efforts.
    I am sure they wanted to do their best. Their best using their knowledge at that time.
    <br>
    There is a big difference between having knowledge, having technical information
    and actually live accordingly.
    That is the trap. I have been there. A lot of personal development books, a lot of articles 
    about how to become, how to achieve etc.
    To no result.
    <br>
    Most of the days i was down. And I remeber wondering myself "was i ever in a better form?How is it to really feel good?".. wow now that i am
    thinking of it it seems surreal, like from another life. It was acctually another life.
    I was asleep while being physically awake.
    My reality have changed so much though.
    I am trying to remember now when was last time i was feeling down, or last time I was angry, or last time I raised the tone at someone. That's a thing of the past.
    <br>
    What life really is?
    Hmm.. the answer to this question can set the path to unimaginable joy which never ends. Is the moment when you "find the thruth which will set you free".
<br>
To get there you have to reset everything that you know. You have to sit down, breath, and let everything be.
Stop trying to control everything, to save the univers and the sharks from drowning. Start looking at yourself. Accept the way you are. Love yourself! Be kind to yourself!
Not only in words but in practice. Honesty is a perfect atu, especially when you are honest to yourself.
Nobody lives inside you, you take you everywhere you go. but you! Don't need to demonstrate anything to anyoane. Make a habit of watching your action, take your time, for what so much hurry?
